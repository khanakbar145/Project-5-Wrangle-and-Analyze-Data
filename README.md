# Project-5-Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data
Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree - Project 4

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, the project gathers data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assesses its quality and tidiness, then provides a cleaned version. This process is known as data wrangling. These wrangling efforts are documents in a Jupyter Notebook and a separate write-up.

The dataset which will be wrangled is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ 


Software Needed
# Need to be able to work in a Jupyter Notebook.

The following packages (libraries) need to be installed:

pandas
NumPy
requests
tweepy
json etc.

key Points
Key points to keep in mind when data wrangling for this project:

The project only need original ratings (no retweets) that have images. Though there are 5000+ tweets in the dataset, not all are dog ratings and some are retweets.
Assessing and cleaning the entire dataset completely would require a lot of time, and is not necessary to practice and demonstrate your skills in data wrangling. Therefore, the requirements of this project are only to assess and clean at least 8 quality issues and at least 2 tidiness issues in this dataset.
Cleaning includes merging individual pieces of data according to the rules of tidy data.
The fact that the rating numerators are greater than the denominators does not need to be cleaned. This unique rating system is a big part of the popularity of WeRateDogs.
The project does not require gathering tweets beyond August 1st, 2017.
